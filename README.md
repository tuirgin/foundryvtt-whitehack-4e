# Unofficial Whitehack 4e System for Foundry VTT v11

This beta fork of a fork addresses outstanding Whitehack 4e compatibility issues, along with a few bug fixes, formatting tweaks, and new support content including:

- Example Characters
- Updated Items, including template class items (vocations and slots), treasure item templates, the injury condition
- Journal Entries, including a Base Sheet Template and a game reference (mostly roll tables)
- Roll Tables, including generators, crits & fumbles, randomized input tables, and reaction & parley
- Macros for both players and Referee, including character creation, rolling HP, rolling selected monster hp, and macros to trigger the roll tables as a secret roll
- Roguelike themed token images based on the SIL-licensed Source Code Pro typeface (see `/assets/tokens`).

## Installation

For now, clone the repository into Foundry's `DATA/systems` directory. Once ready release packages will be made so that the system can be installed in the typical fashion.

**Note that this system requires Foundry v11.**

> **This repo is no longer maintained. If you would like to make a fork please do so and release to Foundry and I'll take this version down**
>
> This system provides support for the [Whitehack RPG 3rd edition](https://whitehackrpg.wordpress.com/) in [FoundryVTT](https://foundryvtt.com). It is published with the approval of Christian Mehrstam, the creator of the Whitehack RPG.
>
> ## Installation
>
> The recommended method of installing the Whitehack 3e system is from within FoundryVTT using the **Install System** option in the **Game Systems** tab. Alternatively you can install it using the manifest [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hellbrandt/foundryvtt-whitehack-3e/main/src/system.json) or download the zip package from the repository's dist folder and install to your FoundryVTT `Data/Systems` folder.
>
> ## Usage
>
> This system includes actor sheets for:
>
> - Characters
> - Monsters/NPCs
>
> It supports items which can be created in the items panel and dragged onto characters, can be created directly in actors:
>
> - Ability
> - Armour
> - Gear
> - Weapon
>
> Players and GMs can make attribute task checks, saves and attack rolls from actor sheets. Armour Class and Encumbrance are calculated based on Armour, Gear and Weapons (see below). Vocation and Species fields are populated from the Abilities tab and cannot be added directly.
>
> There are compendiums for:
>
> - Armour
> - Gear
> - Weapons
>
> Which can be dragged directly onto a character or into the items panel.
>
> The system supports the FoundryVTT initiative system. After actors have been added to the combat tracker you can roll initiative from there or from the relevant token on a battle map.
>
> Full documentation can be accessed in FoundryVTT in the **Game Settings** tab and is also available on the github page for this project [here](https://neilbenson.github.io/foundryvtt-whitehack-3e/)
